# Welcome to Challenges

These are challenges for junior developers that use real scenarios that you can face while working at Inception Health.
There are no tricky assignments, just pure hands-on tasks.

Some important things to note:
- You do not need to build an app to display you work (unless you want to). All you need to do is to write code.
- You are not allowed to use ChatGPT or any other AI bots. You are allowed to use Internet though.
- If react-native/react syntax is not familiar to you, feel free to pseudocode. It won't take any points from you for as long as you show problem-solving skills.
- Be prepared to walk us through your code to explain your thinking.

You can choose to complete any of the following tasks (1 or 2 for extra credit)

## Assignment 1 - Basic Screen and Components
This assignment will test your ability to pass props to reusable components, as well as using loops and basic conditional statements.
For this assignment you need to finish BillingStatement.tsx component. The following component is a card that displays user with basic billing information. There are more details inside component itself.
As soon as BillingStatement.tsx is finished, you need to display it inside BillingHistory.tsx screen. Make sure you display as many BillingStatement components, as records you have.
1. Open the following files: BillingHistory.tsx and BillingStatement.tsx inside src folder
2. Follow instructions inside these files.
