# Welcome to Challenges

These are challenges for junior developers that use real scenarios that you can face while working at Inception Health.
There are no tricky assignments, just pure hands-on tasks.

Some important things to note:
- You do not need to build an app to display you work (unless you want to). All you need to do is to write code.
- You are not allowed to use ChatGPT or any other AI bots. You are allowed to use Internet though.
- If react-native/react syntax is not familiar to you, feel free to pseudcode. It won't take any points from you for as long as you show problem-solving skills.
- Be prepared to walk us through your code to explain you thinking.

You can choose to complete any of the follkowing tasks (1 or 2 for extra credit)

## Assignment 1 - Basic Screen and Component
1. Open the following files: BillingHistory.tsx and BillingStatement.tsx inside src folder
