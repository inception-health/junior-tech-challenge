  1. Display product name, date and amount.
  2. Handle the case when date is undefined to prevent app crash.
  3. Display price in this format: $59.99
  4. Use styles from Stylesheet.create (dont need anything fancy, just basic data visualization).
  5. If price is below 100, display it in red color, otherwise display in black color.
